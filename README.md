# Don't use this!

This is a fork of
[https://github.com/escalate/hugo-split-theme/](https://github.com/escalate/hugo-split-theme/)
for personal use.

Don't use. Use upstream.

You have been warned.

_But why does github not show this as fork?_

Because I created it as clone, so that github does not annoy me with "make a PR
here" notifications!
